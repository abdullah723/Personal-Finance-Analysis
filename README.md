##PERSONAL FINANCE ANALYSIS


#Start analysis with ourself, Before start to any analysis we have to analyse ourself so this Project was quite interesting for me because this analysis is all about my personal finance analysis.

-In this Project we start and analyse Income, Expense & Saving and drag so many Insights from them. So start with KPIs Card there are 8 cards in which we get the information about my Total income, Savings, Expenses and Net Worth in which four cards are showing all time value and rest of four cards showing the filtered values by buttons (Year & Months) and showing trend when we put cursor on it.

-After analysing over all, Now we will analyse Where / How do I spent so in this tree Chart we can easily see how much I spending on what things particularly and also see the trend and then we will analyse Where / How do I invest with the help of vertical bar chart.

-And then we have matrix table which shows the Detailed Statement about a Particular Year and their Components (Income, Saving & Expenses)

-And the last Section In which we analysing Do I spend / save according to what I earn so we got some **Insights**:-

•	In month Sept 2018 my income Increases and the expenses also increases therefore saving decreases even below the target.

•	Same thing happened in Dec 2019 the expenses increases and saving decreases.

•	Max saving Month Mar & May 2018 with the saving of 32.26% of that month income.

•	Max Expensive Month Dec 2019 with the expense of 98.72% and saving was the least around just 1.28% of that month income.
